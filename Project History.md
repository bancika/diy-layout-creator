  <li><strong>Version 4</strong> is the latest version that maintains backwards compatibility with version 3 files, but is switched to Java 8 and has better compatibility with some machines (e.g. Macs).</li>
  <li><strong>Version 3</strong> is the relatively modern version and was re-written from scratch starting early 2010, but this time as an open source Java 5 project. It incorporates all the ideas that were accumulated over years and also better code architecture. That should provide better user experience, less bugs and code that's easier to maintain and extend. </li></ul><ul><li><strong>Version 2</strong> was re-written from scratch in Java mid 2007 and is platform independent. Unfortunately, it's not very fast and is not backward compatible with version 1 which means that it cannot open files created with version 1. It was my first ever Java project, so code is was so great which is why I gave it up at some point. </li></ul><p></p><p align="center"><a href="http://diy-fever.com/diylc/images/diylc2_screenshot.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://diy-fever.com/diylc/images/diylc2_screenshot-320x194.png"></a></p> <p></p><ul><li><strong>Version 1</strong> started its life in May 2005 and was written in Delphi. As such, it only works on windows machines (or through emulators). There's a large collection of layouts submitted by users for this version which is why it's still kept around. </li></ul><p></p><p align="center"><a href="http://diy-fever.com/diylc/images/diylc_screenshot.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://diy-fever.com/diylc/images/diylc_screenshot-320x231.png"></a></p>
