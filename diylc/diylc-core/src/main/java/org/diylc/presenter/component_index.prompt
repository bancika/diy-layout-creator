You are helping me generate Appendix A ? Component Model Reference for an ebook about DIY Layout Creator (DIYLC).

I will provide you with a JSON file that defines all component types used by DIYLC.

Your task

Convert the JSON into a single DOCX appendix that documents all components defined in the JSON, with no omissions and no inferred or invented information.

Structure rules (must follow exactly)
1. Document structure

Output format: DOCX

Document title (H1):
Appendix A ? Component Model Reference

Group components by category

Each category is an H2 heading

Category order: alphabetical

Component order within category: alphabetical

2. Component entry format

Do NOT use H3 or any heading for component names.

For each component, render the following:

Component Name (bold, normal paragraph)
Description: <exact description text from JSON>
Creation method: <human-friendly label>


Creation method mapping:

POINT_BY_POINT ? Point-by-point

SINGLE_CLICK ? Single-click

Missing value ? (not specified)

3. Properties table

If the component defines properties, render a table immediately after the metadata:

| Property | Type | Possible values |

Table formatting requirements:

No visible borders (markdown-style look)

Column widths:

Property: 30%

Type: 30%

Possible values: 40%

Header row:

Bold text

Very light gray background (#EEEEEE)

Data rows:

Alternating row background

Very very light gray (#F7F7F7) on every second row

Row height:

As compact as possible

No extra vertical padding

Content rules:

Property name ? JSON name

Type ? JSON type

Possible values:

Populate only if the JSON defines an enum/list

Leave empty otherwise

If a component has no properties, write:

This component has no configurable properties.

4. Styling consistency

Font: Calibri

Base text size: 11 pt

Match the visual style of previously generated ebook chapters

No decorative elements

Clean, technical, reference-style layout

Strict constraints

? Do NOT summarize components

? Do NOT invent descriptions, properties, or values

? Do NOT rename properties or types

? Do NOT add commentary or interpretation

? Do NOT introduce additional columns

Everything must come directly from the JSON.

Final output

Produce one DOCX file

File name:
Appendix A ? Component Model Reference.docx

When finished, provide a download link to the DOCX file.

Acknowledge when you are ready to receive the JSON file.
