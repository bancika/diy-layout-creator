# Get the absolute path to a symbolic link's reference.
#
# Parameters:
#     $* : path - the path to the file (link) to dereference (can have spaces in
#                 the path).
#
# Output:
#     This function writes the path to the link reference to stdout.
#
# Note: This function is not capable of detecting that one or more directories
#       in the path is also a link and unravelling that.

#
# Parameters:
#     $* : path - the path to examine, presumably the resolved path to this
#                 script (can have spaces in the path).
#
# Output:
#     If successful, this function outputs the absolute path to a directory
#     containing the Java binary, and ../lib/deploy.jar; otherwise it outputs
#     an empty string.  (Output is to stdout.)

#            <jre-root>/bin
#
#       However, as long as the directory pointed by the path returned by this
#       function contains:
#
#            ./java
#            ../lib/deploy.jar
#
#       it should be possible to successfully launch the JCP from the given
#       information.
